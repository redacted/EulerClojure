This repo contains solutions for several Project Euler problems.

Some of the solutions are adapted from (or taken from):

http://clojure-euler.wikispaces.com/

http://clojure.roboloco.net/

Thanks to the authors of those sites my knowledge of Clojure improved greatly!


Multiple approaches to the same problem can be seen in the 'alt' etc files.
